Bridging the SNAP gap: The Future of Food Assistance Programs in Chicago

 Sara Cooper, Christiana Freitag, Janani Janarthanan, Menatalla Ibrahim

    The Issue
In the wake of new federal policies threatening food assistance, Chicago faces an alarming disparity: the neighborhoods most reliant on SNAP benefits often have the fewest places to spend them. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides vital help to over 42 million Americans (about 22 million households) monthly. In Illinois alone, roughly 1.9 million residents use SNAP to help put food on the table as of March 2025. Yet in Chicago’s poorest community areas, where upwards of half of households rely on SNAP, there is a striking mismatch between need and access, with few or no nearby stores that accept SNAP benefits. Our project shines a light on these SNAP access gaps: which neighborhoods are most underserved, why it matters, and how stopgap measures like food pantries try to fill in. This story is critical now, as recent federal budget changes are poised to cut SNAP and shift costs to states, putting hundreds of thousands at risk of losing benefits. 
Even before those cuts, we illustrate how communities in Chicago’s South and West Sides have been “SNAP deserts” – areas of high SNAP usage but low retailer presence. As one local advocate warned during an interview with WBEZ, if SNAP falters, “demand will rise for things like food pantries… those pantries are going to be stretched very thin.”
Our goal is to highlight these critical gaps and the people affected, at a time when SNAP, the nation’s most vital anti-hunger program, is under threat.

    Our Approach
We combined multiple datasets to investigate this disparity. First, we obtained historical SNAP retailer data from the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which provides locations and details of every store authorized to accept SNAP since 2004. This allowed us to map out where SNAP benefits can be used. Next, using the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (via Census Reporter), we gathered data on households receiving SNAP by census tract across Chicago (ACS table B22001). Each tract’s data included the number of households on SNAP and the total households, which we used to calculate the percentage of households on SNAP – a proxy for community need. Because Chicago’s dozens of census tracts can be hard to discuss individually, we aligned each tract with its corresponding community area (there are 77 official community areas in Chicago). Using the city’s community area boundary map, we spatially joined tracts (and store locations) to community areas. This enabled us to aggregate metrics for neighborhoods readers recognize (like Englewood or Humboldt Park) rather than obscure tract IDs. We derived two key figures for each community area: SNAP reliance (the percentage of households on SNAP) and SNAP retailer density (the number of SNAP-authorized stores located there). We also broke down the types of retailers to see whether areas with high SNAP usage are served mostly by small corner shops instead of full-service grocers.

    Analysis and Findings
Retailer Types Matter: Beyond the raw count of stores, the quality and type of SNAP retailers vary dramatically by community. We analyzed the store list by category (as defined by the USDA) – distinguishing supermarkets and large grocers from smaller convenience stores and specialty shops. Citywide, the majority of SNAP-authorized outlets are small convenience stores or mini-marts, far outnumbering supermarkets. This diversity is by design: “SNAP retailers range from local grocers to large supermarket chains”, according to the USDA, but it has implications for access to nutritious food. 

In wealthier or more suburban neighborhoods, SNAP recipients can redeem benefits at well-stocked supermarkets or big-box stores. However, in many high-poverty Chicago neighborhoods, the SNAP retailer network skews heavily toward tiny corner stores selling limited produce. Our data show this clearly. For instance, in North Lawndale, more than half of its ~240 SNAP-accepting businesses are convenience stores or gas station markets, with very few full-service groceries. Englewood, despite its need, has seen major chain supermarkets close in recent years, leaving mostly small shops on our map. In West Garfield Park, the only large grocery store closed in 2022, and our 2024 snapshot of SNAP retailers in that area consists almost entirely of convenience marts. This finding aligns with concerns raised by community advocates about “greenlining” – the idea that certain businesses (like healthy grocery chains) avoid disinvested neighborhoods, effectively limiting SNAP users to less healthy and often higher-priced food options. We plan a follow-up visualization breaking down each community area’s retailer mix, illustrating, for example, that in food-insecure areas, over 80% of SNAP sites may be small convenience or liquor stores, versus a far lower percentage of such stores in more affluent areas. These disparities underscore that not all SNAP-accessible stores are equal: relying on a corner store for groceries is a far cry from having a supermarket in your neighborhood.

Trend Over Time: Because our retailer dataset spans back to 2004, we also explored how the landscape of SNAP-authorized stores has changed. Overall, Chicago’s number of participating retailers grew over the past two decades, mirroring national trends. There are more stores like dollar stores and pharmacies joining SNAP now than 20 years ago. However, that growth was uneven. We attempted a year-by-year analysis (a challenging task with this dataset) to see if some neighborhoods gained or lost SNAP retailers disproportionately. While a full-time series map is beyond our current scope, preliminary checks suggest that areas that were already underserved a decade ago (like parts of the Far South Side) have seen little improvement in attracting new SNAP-approved grocers. Some even saw net losses as legacy supermarkets closed. On the other hand, booming areas such as the Loop and Near North added many new stores (e.g. big-box retailers with groceries now accept SNAP downtown). This provides context for our main finding: the SNAP gap in Chicago is long-standing and structural, not merely a temporary fluctuation. It also validates our focus on community areas: as advised, looking at broader areas rather than individual tracts made it easier to identify these persistent gaps.
          
    Data and Methodology Details
Data Sources: We drew from authoritative public datasets for this project. The USDA SNAP Retailer Locator – Historical Dataset was our source for store locations and characteristics. This dataset (updated to December 31, 2024) includes every retailer authorized to accept SNAP in the US since 2004, with fields for store name, type, address, and the dates when the store was authorized (and if applicable, when it ended participation). From this, we extracted all stores located in the City of Chicago (using latitude and longitude coordinates). We supplemented store addresses with Chicago’s Community Areas shapefile (from the city’s open data portal) to determine each store’s community area.

For SNAP beneficiary data, we used the American Community Survey five-year estimates (the most recent available, 2017–2021) at the census tract level. Specifically, we pulled table B22001, which counts households receiving food stamps/SNAP in the past 12 months (and those not receiving) by tract. From this, we calculated “% of households on SNAP” per tract. We then aggregated to community areas by summing households on SNAP and total households across all tracts within each community area, and computing the percentage from those sums. (Chicago’s community areas are built from whole census tracts, which made this aggregation reasonably accurate.) This provided a single SNAP participation rate for each community area, which we used in community-level maps and charts. 
Source note: The ACS data (via Census Reporter and data.census.gov) comes with margins of error, but for our purposes, we treated the estimates as is. According to the Census Bureau, about 18% of Chicago households were receiving SNAP during this period (for context), though in some community areas that figure is much higher.

    Analysis Process: 
Our analysis involved data cleaning, joining, and calculation steps in Python. 

Key steps included:
Cleaning the SNAP Retailer data: After filtering to Chicago locations, we removed a small number of records with obvious errors (e.g. invalid coordinates). We noticed that some stores appeared multiple times if they had multiple authorization periods; to avoid double-counting, we treated each unique store (by location and name) as a single entity, using the latest status. We also standardized store types into broader categories (e.g. grouping “Small Grocery Store” and “Medium Grocery Store” together in some analyses) for simplicity.

Joining Community Areas: Using Chicago’s community area boundaries, we performed a spatial join for both datasets. Each SNAP store was tagged with a community area name and number based on its point location. Each census tract was assigned to a community area (since nearly all tracts fall entirely inside one area). For a handful of tracts on the city border that overlapped two community areas, we assigned them to the area containing the majority of its land area. This join enabled us to create a community-level summary table with: Community Area, Total SNAP-using Households, Total Households, SNAP Participation %, and Number of SNAP Retailers.

Calculating Ratios and Rankings: We added fields to measure store density relative to the SNAP-recipient population. One metric was households-per-store (number of SNAP households divided by number of stores in that area)-- a higher number indicates an area potentially underserved by retailers. Another was simply stores per 10,000 residents, to compare raw accessibility. We ranked community areas by these metrics to highlight the top and bottom neighborhoods. For instance, Burnside emerged as the community with the fewest SNAP stores per household (a problematic ratio). At the same time, Austin had one of the best ratios (many stores for its large SNAP population).


    Data Challenges and Caveats: 
Like any data project, we encountered several issues that required attention:

Anomalous Values: We discovered a few tracts with negative values for the estimated number of SNAP households. Obviously, negative households do not exist – this was an artifact of how the ACS publishes certain derived estimates or margins of error. In these cases, we treated the negative figures as zero (assuming the true value is very low) and moved on. These anomalies were limited to a couple of tracts with very small populations, so this adjustment had a negligible impact on community-level percentages.

Missing Community Assignments: A handful of SNAP retailer records initially came through with no community area match. On investigation, most of these were stores right on the city boundary or with slight geocoding errors (e.g., a store’s coordinates placed it just outside the city polygon, or in a corner that the community area map file didn’t cover). We resolved most by correcting the coordinates or using the store’s address to assign the proper community manually. One or two records (such as a retailer located in the O’Hare Airport area) needed special handling since the O’Hare community area is sometimes omitted in datasets. We ensured every store in our final analysis is linked to a community area; those without a clear match were excluded from community counts to avoid distortion.

Data Freshness: The SNAP retailer data is current as of the end of 2024, and our ACS data reflects 2017–2021 survey averages. There may have been changes since then – for instance, some new stores may have opened in 2025 or more households may have enrolled in SNAP during the economic changes of 2022–2024. We attempted to get the most recent information available (the USDA dataset updates annually, and the ACS 5-year is the latest comprehensive snapshot). We also cross-checked known major store closings or openings in 2025 against our data; where aware of discrepancies, we noted them in the story. Overall, the patterns we identify (which neighborhoods have high need and low access) are long-term and unlikely to have reversed in a year or two.

Defining “Store” and Food Access: Not every SNAP-authorized establishment is a traditional grocery store – the dataset includes everything from supermarkets to gas station convenience stores, as long as they are approved to accept benefits. We kept all these in our analysis, because even a gas station selling milk and bread plays a role in food access. However, readers should note that having many SNAP retailers does not always equal good access to healthy food. Our analysis of store types addresses this to a degree. Also, our count of stores does not consider store size or inventory: a single Walmart Supercenter and a small corner market each count as one “store” in our data. This is a limitation when interpreting raw store counts. We mitigated it by examining store categories and by referencing external context (like whether an area’s only SNAP store is just a gas station mini-mart).

Despite these caveats, the data is robust enough to support the story’s central insights. We clearly see the geography of SNAP access in Chicago and have taken care to verify that the highlights are backed by multiple data points.



    Using the Data and Resources

This section serves as a guide for anyone who wants to replicate our analysis or explore the data further. All data and code for this project are organized in our repository (see the project’s data folder and code notebook). Here’s how to make the most of it:

Data Files: The file snap_retailers_chicago.csv contains all SNAP-authorized retailers in Chicago (2004–2024), with their coordinates, store type, and community area. 
The file chicago_snap_households.csv contains the ACS-derived metrics for each community area – including total households, SNAP households, and the percentage on SNAP (plus some demographics for context, if needed). 
We also include snap_gap_by_community.xlsx which compiles key results (like store counts, ratios, rankings by community) for quick reference. 
All source data citations are documented: USDA FNS for retailer data, U.S. Census Bureau ACS for household data, etc. 
If you use these data, please credit those sources.

    Future Updates: 
We acknowledge that data like this benefits from periodic updates. 
The USDA releases updated retailer data annually (usually mid-year for the prior year), and the ACS publishes new 5-year estimates each year. 
We recommend updating the analysis with 2025 data when available, to capture any effects post-pandemic or after the policy changes. 
Our code is set up to accommodate new data with minimal changes – for instance, one can swap in the 2018–2022 ACS data file when it’s out. 
The README in the repository provides more detailed instructions on updating data sources and re-running analyses.

We hope journalists, researchers, and community organizations can use this work as a framework to investigate SNAP access in other cities or to dig deeper into Chicago’s situation. 
The combination of public data and open-source analysis makes it possible to hold policymakers accountable: if certain neighborhoods have been left behind, the data will show it.
