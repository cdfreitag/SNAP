# SNAP
The purpose of the project is to create an intersecion of the need for SNAP at a household level according to community areas and the availability of SNAP stores in their community areas in all the various forms from supermarkets to convenience stores.

Datasets:

1. American Community Survey Data 
Available on: https://data.census.gov/table?q=acs&y=2023 

We have considered the 2019-2023 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for  this project.

This data was published in Dec 2024 and is the most recent data available at this time. The data is breaks down the local statistics for multiple topics from work status to educational level, language spoken at home, nativity, veteran status, and selected monthly homeowner costs. The data is segregated by households, by age, family size, number of workers and disability status to name a few. The data also includes estimates and their margins of error.
